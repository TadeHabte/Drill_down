# Drill_down
Check this four level drill down chart .I am using a [highchart](https://jkunst.com/highcharter/articles/drilldown.html) with some [JS API references](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/) to produce four level drill down.If users want to have deeper look to Ã½our data  without jumping to another chart, drill down comes as a solution.

The drill flow is as below: \

UNHCR Bureau==>>Type of POCs(for selected  Bureau)==>>Country of Asylum( for selected Bureau & Type of POCs )==>>Country of origin( in that country of Asylum)

Here is the link see the drill down :
